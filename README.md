# Sudoko-solver

- In sudoku folder, sudoku.py contain the solver implementation and app.py contains
implementing and manipulating the solver on our website
- Static Folder contains javascript and css files that controls the style, input and validation
of the application, including matrix for the game and the number select panel.
- Templates Folder contains HTML files that contain the HTML structure of the
application before solving and after solving the puzzle.
- I have created a program that will show how the computer solves the Sudoku puzzle by using backtracking.
